# AdventurersPack
Set of applications I'm developing to learn Java and to aid my DnD game.
Based on D&D 5e rules.

Step 1 is a simple dice rolling app
Step 2 is a character builder/manager 
  (with eventual inport/export functionality for both entire characters as well as databases of classes, races, skills, spells etc.)
Step 3 is a complete DM screen/campaign management tool

## Current status:
Step 1: Initial command-line application working
Next ToDo: Build GUI
